Always wanted to study Physics, Mathematics or Computer-Science, I got lost several years in the Architecture field thanks to a family insult message back in 2015. I decided to make the move now and thought it was a clever choice to get into CS instead of basic sciences in term of career path as an adult. I like rigor, organization and efficiency.
